# Spaceship Titanic

In this note book i will explore and process the Dataset to train a ML binary classification, and after I'll increase the results consistency using Hyperparameters tunning techniques. I will also program a simple RNA just for comparison. Usually, when a small amount of data is being analysed, ML techniques tend to be better than DL development. 

## Description

This project aims to find if a passenger was transported off the Titanic based on his personal data, his position in the ship and the money this passenger spent in the ship attractions. . Data was taken from kaggle: `https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview` 

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
